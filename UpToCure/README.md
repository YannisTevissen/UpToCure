## About UpToCure

UpToCure leverages artificial intelligence to generate comprehensive reports about rare disease research. While the system aims for accuracy, users should be aware that the AI-generated content may occasionally contain inaccuracies. Always refer to the original research sources provided in each report for the most precise information.

## Features

- 📝 AI-assisted generation of rare disease research reports
- 📊 Automated extraction of key information from medical research
- 🎠 Responsive carousel interface for browsing multiple reports
- 🔄 REST API for programmatic access to research reports
- 🔄 Auto-refresh capability to display the latest reports
- 🔧 Development tools for testing and extending functionality
- 🎨 Clean, accessible user interface for medical information

## System Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- PDM (Python Dependency Manager)
- Modern web browser

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run UpToCure is using PDM:

```bash
pdm run run
```

This will:
1. Check and install required dependencies
2. Ensure the reports directory exists
3. Check for sample reports (create one if none exist)
4. Start the FastAPI server
5. Open your browser to view the application

## Adding Your Own Reports

To add your own reports:

1. Create a markdown (.md) file in the `reports` directory
2. Format your markdown file with:
   - A title (using # at the beginning)
   - Content about rare disease research (any markdown is supported)
   - Optional date (using *Last updated: DATE* format)
   - References to original research sources

Example:
```markdown
# Research Progress in Gaucher's Disease Treatment

This report summarizes recent advances in enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease.

**Key findings:**
* Improved delivery mechanisms for glucocerebrosidase
* New clinical trials showing enhanced outcomes in Type 1 patients

*Last updated: January 21, 2025*

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/reports` - Retrieve all processed rare disease research reports
- `GET /` - View the frontend application

## Development

For manual setup:

1. Install PDM: `pip install pdm`
2. Setup the project: `pdm install`
3. Run the server: `pdm run run-backend`

## Testing the API

There are two ways to test the API:

1. Using your browser:
   - Start the application using `pdm run run`
   - Visit `http://localhost:8000/api/reports` in your browser

2. Using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/reports | jq
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **No reports showing up?** Check that your markdown files are in the `reports` directory and formatted correctly.
- **Server won't start?** Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and PDM installed.
- **API errors?** Check the server logs for detailed error messages.

The reports generated by UpToCure are created with an AI agent that can sometimes hallucinate or present inaccurate information. For precise medical information, please refer to the original research sources provided in each report.
