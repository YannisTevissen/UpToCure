Gaucher's disease is a rare genetic disorder that results in the harmful buildup of fatty substances in certain organs, particularly the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. These fatty substances prevent cells and organs from working properly.

The disease is caused by mutations in the GBA gene, which leads to a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is needed to break down a fatty substance called glucocerebroside.

**Symptoms vary widely and may include:**
- Enlarged liver and spleen
- Bone pain and fractures
- Anemia and fatigue
- Easy bruising and bleeding

Treatment often involves enzyme replacement therapy.
