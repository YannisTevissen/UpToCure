# Advancements in Treating Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2: Current Research and Future Directions

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor function. While historically considered a devastating diagnosis with limited treatment options, the past decade has seen remarkable progress in therapeutic development. This report synthesizes recent breakthroughs, ongoing clinical trials, and emerging research directions aimed at improving outcomes for SMA Type 2 patients.

## Understanding SMA Type 2 and Its Genetic Basis

SMA Type 2 is caused by mutations in the *SMN1* gene, which is critical for producing survival motor neuron (SMN) protein—a key factor in maintaining motor neurons. Patients with SMA Type 2 typically retain one or two copies of the *SMN2* gene, a "backup" gene that produces small amounts of functional SMN protein. The severity of symptoms correlates with the number of *SMN2* copies: more copies generally result in milder disease.

Current therapies focus on increasing SMN protein levels by modulating *SMN2* splicing (e.g., **nusinersen** and **risdiplam**) or replacing the defective *SMN1* gene via gene therapy (**onasemnogene abeparvovec/Zolgensma**).

## Next-Generation Gene Therapies for Broader Patient Access

### Intrathecal Zolgensma for Older Patients

Novartis' **STEER trial** (NCT05089656) represents a pivotal effort to expand access to Zolgensma, a gene therapy currently approved for SMA Type 1 patients under two years of age. The Phase III study evaluated intrathecal (spinal canal) administration of Zolgensma in SMA Type 2 patients aged 2–18 years who had never walked. Topline results released in December 2024 showed the therapy met its primary endpoint, improving motor function compared to a placebo.

This advancement addresses a critical unmet need: older and heavier patients often exceed weight-based eligibility criteria for intravenous Zolgensma. If approved, intrathecal delivery could offer a functional cure for SMA Type 2 by restoring SMN protein production in motor neurons.

## Muscle-Targeted Therapies to Complement SMN Restoration

### Apitegromab: Enhancing Muscle Function

Scholar Rock's **apitegromab**, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting myostatin activation, has emerged as a promising adjunct therapy for SMA Type 2. Myostatin is a protein that limits muscle growth; blocking its activity can increase muscle mass and strength. The Phase III **SAPPHIRE trial** (NCT05156320) demonstrated that apitegromab, combined with existing SMN-enhancing therapies (nusinersen or risdiplam), significantly improved motor function in patients with later-onset SMA.

Key milestones include:
* **Biologics License Application (BLA) submission** to the FDA in Q1 2025.
* A planned Phase II **OPAL trial** (mid-2025) to evaluate apitegromab in SMA patients under two years old, potentially bridging the gap between infant and older patient therapies.

## Emerging Research Directions

### CRISPR-Based Gene Editing

Preclinical studies explore **CRISPR-Cas9** and **prime editing** technologies to correct *SMN1* mutations or enhance *SMN2* splicing. While still in early stages, these techniques aim to provide a one-time curative treatment by repairing the genetic root cause of SMA.

### Combination Therapies

Researchers are investigating combinations of SMN-enhancing drugs (e.g., risdiplam) and muscle-targeted agents (e.g., apitegromab) to maximize therapeutic impact. Early animal studies show enhanced outcomes when these approaches are paired, and small human trials are exploring the safety of combining Zolgensma with nusinersen.

## Conclusion

The treatment landscape for SMA Type 2 is evolving rapidly, with promising developments in targeted gene therapies, muscle-enhancing agents, and combination approaches. As research advances, the hope for improved quality of life and functional outcomes for patients with SMA Type 2 continues to grow.
