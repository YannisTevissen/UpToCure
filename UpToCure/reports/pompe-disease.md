# Pompe Disease

Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and breathing problems. It's caused by the buildup of glycogen, a complex sugar, in the body's cells. This accumulation damages muscle cells throughout the body.

The disease is caused by mutations in the GAA gene, which provides instructions for making the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. This enzyme is essential for breaking down glycogen in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells.

**Symptoms depend on the age of onset but may include:**
- Muscle weakness
- Poor muscle tone
- Enlarged liver
- Heart problems
- Breathing difficulties
- Delayed motor skills

Treatment includes enzyme replacement therapy and supportive care measures.
