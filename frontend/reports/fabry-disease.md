# Fabry Disease

Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide.

Without enough of this enzyme, this fatty substance builds up in the body's cells, particularly cells lining blood vessels in the skin and cells in the kidneys, heart, and nervous system.

**Primary symptoms include:**
- Burning pain in the hands and feet
- Small, dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas)
- Decreased ability to sweat
- Cloudiness of the front part of the eye
- Kidney problems
- Heart disease
- Increased risk of stroke

Treatment options include enzyme replacement therapy and medications to address specific symptoms.
