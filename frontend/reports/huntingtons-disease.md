# Huntington's Disease

Huntington's disease is a rare, inherited disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. This degenerative brain disorder affects a person's functional abilities and usually results in movement, cognitive and psychiatric disorders.

The disease is caused by an inherited defect in a single gene. Huntington's is known as an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that a person needs only one copy of the defective gene to develop the disorder.

**Common symptoms include:**
- Involuntary jerking or writhing movements (chorea)
- Muscle problems, such as rigidity or muscle contracture
- Slow or abnormal eye movements
- Impaired gait, posture and balance
- Cognitive decline

There is no cure, but medications can help manage symptoms.
